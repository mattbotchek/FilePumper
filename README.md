NOTE: I made this wonderfully terrible idea when I was about 14-15, and looking back, I deeply regret how poorly I did with this. That is all  
  
  The file pumper has three options that you can chose from when using the program. The infinite file generator, the file pumper 
(files a file with random numbers) and the single file creator (Usually used for pumping a file)

  When you clone or download the program open your terminal and change directory until you are in the src folder and then run 
java FilePumperMain options will then appear and follow their instructions to figure out the correct pathname usage for the 
option you have chosen.

  The pathnames have to be full pathnames otherwise the program will return an error or create a bunch of files in a the 
incorrect place that you told them to go. ie, on Mac it would look like this: /Users/your-name/Where-you-want-it/test.txt 
Or if you are using the infinite file creator use /Users/your-name/Where-you-want-it/ without a filename or .txt

  Any and all damages that you cause while using this program are not my fault and if you goof upand create files in the 
wrong location then that is also not my fault. Otherwise you can modify this as much as you want and you can use this in
other programs as much as you want.

  Have fun.
